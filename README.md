# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview<br>
The purpose of the analysis was to classify the success of charitable donations. This was accomplished with deep learning neural-networks using the TensorFlow platform<br>

## Results
### Data Preprocessing<br>
- Target column "IS_SUCCESSFUL" is the target for the deep learning neural network
- Feature columns for the deep learning neural network include "APPLICATION_TYPE", "AFFILIATION", "CLASSIFICATION", "USE_CASE", "ORGANIZATION", "STATUS", "INCOME_AMT", "SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS", "ASK_AMT"
- Features "EIN" and "NAME" are dropped 

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
